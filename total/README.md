# Analysis with threshold value 0.500

These scripts will allow you to extract the parameters and help you analyze the possible apperance of the free-scale property in the graphs.

There are two different files:
  - one is a traditional Python script, where the functions are defined to compute the different parameters and within the `if __name__ == “__main__”` is where the code that will be exectuted when running the file, either by using a console comand (`python3 myscript.py`) or using a graphical interface such as PyCharm or Visual Studio (or whichever you may use). [Note: with this one, you just give the location where you have the files, where you want the parameters to go and the percentages you want, and everything is automatized]
  - and a IPython nootebook, wich I only recomend when you are starting, just to get a feeling on how the code functions, or if you want to be analyze file by file.
